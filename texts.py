    **Crypto Portfolio Tracker Bot**

    This bot helps you track your cryptocurrency portfolio by allowing you to easily add, view, and manage your holdings. It can track the amount, purchase price, and current value of each coin you own. The bot also calculates your profits or losses based on the current market price of your assets.

    ### Features:
    - **Add Coins**: Easily add coins to your portfolio by specifying the coin symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH), the amount you own, and the purchase price.
    - **Update Holdings**: If you buy more of the same coin, simply add it again, and the bot will update your portfolio, showing the average purchase price and total amount.
    - **View Portfolio**: Use the `/portfolio` command to see your entire portfolio, including:
      - Amount of each coin
      - Average purchase price (if added multiple times)
      - Current price of each coin
      - Total value of your holdings
      - Profit or loss based on the difference between the current price and your average purchase price.
      
    ### Example Usage:
    1. Add a coin to your portfolio:  
       `BTC 0.5 30000`  
       This will add 0.5 BTC to your portfolio at a purchase price of $30,000 per coin.

    2. View your portfolio:  
       `/portfolio`  
       The bot will show the total value of your assets, along with details for each coin.
